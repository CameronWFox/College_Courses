Included in this directory is a simple random number generation library written in ANSI C. 

If you want to use it "stand alone" in test mode, uncomment the line "#define RNG_TEST_BLOC' in the file
rng.c and complie with something like:

cc rng.c -lm -o rng_test

Assuming that rng.h is in the same directory with rng.c, this will compile the library as a stand
alonetest program.  See the rng.c for details in the definition of main()

If you want to use it as a library, make sure the line '#define RNG_TEST_BLOC' in rng.c is commented and
build it with something like the included Makefile.  That make file will copy the header rng.h into the 
directory ./include and place the compiled binary (for linking to your code) in ./objs.  You can modify the
included makefile to put the headder and object files in places more convenient to you, or just copy them
there manually.
