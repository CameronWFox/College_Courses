Overview: This lab will be showing the amount of time it will take to cut the grass of a rectangle yard.
This lab will take input data use it for calculations and then display results of the calculations.

Known Issues:

Known Values:


    Rate of square feet per Second: 2;
    Rate of squared feet per minute: rate of feet per second * 60;

Inputs:             // The inputs used for the calculations

    Get the yardWidth in feet;
    Get the yardLength in feet;

    Get the houseWidth in feet;
    Get the houseLength in feet;

Calculations:       // The calculations using the input values gathered from the user

Determine the HouseArea:
    houseLength ft * houseWidth ft;

Determine the TotalArea:
    yardLength ft * yardWidth ft;

    Determine the Yard Area (With out the houseArea):yardArea = totalArea ft^2 - houseArea ft^2;

    Determine the amount of time it takes to cut the grass in minutes:
        grassCutTime = ((yardArea ft^2 / Rate of square feet per Second);

Results:            // The time it took to cut the grass for the whole yard and the Area of the Yard.

The Area of the yard itself not including the house:
        YardArea ft^2;

The time it took to cut the grass in minutes:
        GrassCutTime;

        This algorithm was designed by Cameron Fox.
