Overview: I will be writing an algorithm
to find the cost of paint needed to apply
one coat to the walls of a rectangular room.
The algorithm takes in input, uses calculations, then displays the results.

Known Issues:

    cost of paint per gallon;

    cost = The number of gallons times the price per gallon;
    area of the rectangular room = The width and height of each wall and add them together;

    Output; //The results of the calculations

    return The total cost of paint needed to paint one coat across all the walls of the room;
