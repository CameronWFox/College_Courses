For my Hash Project 4, I ended up using double hashing because it can simplify down 
the process of my coding. I was having difficulty with building the project
but I was able to get help from a classmate and she was able to help me understand 
how double hashing works a bit better. 
I see that double hashing works very well and it is very effective. 
I code is very clearly written and I see that double hashing is easy for me to 
understand and see how everything works. From what I can tell everything operates and runs
smoothly and cleanly. 
I did multiple tests of inserting, finding, removing and alpha. 
Each one works and is fully functional. 
I tested my methods by adding in about 7 or 8 values then 
I run through a find and remove test. Then I do a test for the alpha result.
