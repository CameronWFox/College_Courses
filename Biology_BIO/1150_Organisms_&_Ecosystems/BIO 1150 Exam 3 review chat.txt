Good point. I will simply ask people to watch the chat and be patient. I can only answer one question at a time, so we'll need to pace the questions.
Fox, Cameron
3:56 PM
I hope that works. I guess we will find out.
Cipollini, Don

*The capsule of a bacteria is what it uses to bind to substrates right?
4:07 PM
- Prince, Loren joined the Main Room. ( 7:08 PM ) -
Cipollini, Don
4:08 PM
There are big differences between primitive plants like moss and flowering plants, for example. It would be good to know what the major transitions between the groups of plants (non vascular, seedless vasculr, gymnosperms, angiosperms).
Big concepts to draw are how the major parts of life stages shifted in dominance through evolutionary time.
4:09 PM
Capsule: this is used to bind to surfaces, but also for protection.
4:09 PM
Fox, Cameron
4:10 PM
When it comes to the life cycle diagrams of plants, trees, and the other life cyc;es we have taked about, do we need to have every step fuly memorized or have a general understanding of what happens at each step?
Adkins, Blake
4:11 PM
should we know the 5 traites of seed plants?
Cipollini, Don
4:11 PM
As I mentioned in class, I'd like you to know the main stages and what's goinf on at each stage. In the floering plants diagram, for example, I mentioned that there are lots of names for cells and such that I didn;t stress.
Yes, you should know what makes a plant a plant.
4:11 PM
Kessler, Karleigh
4:12 PM
one of the study questions from the textbokk says that slime molds are unicellular organisms and their movment stems from diploid cells following nutrients. I am having trouble understanding how the dipolid cells are involved in the slime molds movement. or i could just be completely wrong on what the textbook meant by this.
- Vanhoose, Madyson joined the Main Room. ( 7:13 PM ) -
Cipollini, Don
4:13 PM
Actually, that is correct. Think about the slime mold as a mass of cells all moving in some kind of unified fashion toward nutrients or away from some negative stimulus.
- Vanhoose, Madyson left the Main Room. ( 7:14 PM ) -
Cipollini, Don
4:14 PM
by the way, pardon my typos. I'm just trying to type fast!
Fox, Cameron

Should we have all the super group information we talked about memorized or make sure we have a general understanding of each group?
- Mamedova, Zheylan joined the Main Room. ( 7:18 PM ) -
Poole, Andrea
4:17 PM
Are we going to have to be able to identify each step of classification for all the protists and plants we learned and identify what makes them special? Like ciliates are aveolates which are part of the SAR clade which is in protists and they have multiple nuclei?
Cipollini, Don
4:17 PM
Medicine: that slide is there mostly to illustrate the importance of plants for humans, including int he manufacture of medicines. Don;t worry about those things fo rthis exam, we'll revisit that later in the semester.
- Kash, Gary left the Main Room. ( 7:18 PM ) -
Cipollini, Don
4:19 PM
Andrea, in a nutshell yes. You should know what characteristics makes a particular protist a member of a certian supergroup, and know the mjor examples that were provided that illustrate the features.
- Massie, Amber left the Main Room. ( 7:20 PM ) -
Yi, Xixi
4:20 PM
Are Rhizaria and chromalveolata supergroup? or are them grouped in the "SAR clade", which is the supergroup.
Cipollini, Don
4:20 PM
Andrea, what else makes ciliates special?
Poole, Andrea
4:20 PM
They use conjuction?
Ezenagu, Oluebube
4:20 PM
Other than genetic evidence that shows charophyte are most closely related to land plants, how other concepts supports their close relationship? Also other than have green algae as common ancestors, does chlorophytes have any other similarites with plant?
Adkins, Blake
4:20 PM
should we know all the examples of types of bacteria ( alpha,beta,gamma)
and their examples?
4:21 PM
Cipollini, Don
4:21 PM
Don;t worry about the mutiple types of proteobacteria in terms of alpha, beta, gamma, but kn ow that v ariation exists.

- Kash, Gary joined the Main Room. ( 7:23 PM ) -
Cipollini, Don
4:22 PM
Charophytes shares lots of features that are similar to plants, in their seaweed-like structre, but the genetic evidence is key. Chlorophytes are closely related too, but charophytes closer.
Andrea, that is one thing that makes ciliates special, but what is another obvious one?
4:24 PM
anyone?
4:25 PM
Ezenagu, Oluebube
4:25 PM
cilia are able to move?
Kessler, Karleigh
4:25 PM
is it that cilliates have 2 nuclei a MACRO and a MICRO
Poole, Andrea
4:25 PM
The only other "feature" I know of is that paramecium are ciliates?
Cipollini, Don
4:26 PM
Yes, cilia. They are covered by them, moreso than any other protists.
Velasco Romo, Dayra
4:26 PM
Is it that they have hairy flagella?
Ezenagu, Oluebube
4:26 PM
Cilia are single cell?
Cipollini, Don
4:26 PM
Hairy flagella is a feature of another clade. Who knows which one?
Many protists are singe celled, so that is no special fo rthem.
4:26 PM
Poole, Andrea
4:26 PM
Stramenopiles?
Cipollini, Don
4:27 PM
Andrea-yes
Ezenagu, Oluebube
4:27 PM
Dinoflagellate
Cipollini, Don
4:27 PM
What is a characteristic of dinoflagellates?
Notice that many of these hnts are in the names themselves. Think about the roots of these words.
4:27 PM
Adkins, Blake
4:28 PM
they have two flagella and each cell is renforced by cellulose plates?
- Roose, Lauren joined the Main Room. ( 7:29 PM ) -
Yancey, Allison
4:28 PM
They have two flagella?
Cipollini, Don
4:28 PM
yes
Ezenagu, Oluebube
4:28 PM
Dinoflagellates have two flagella. a smooth one and an hairy one
Poole, Andrea
4:28 PM
Were you refering to the stramenopiles or paramecium with your yes?
Adkins, Blake
4:29 PM
are there any definitions we should pay attention too?
Cipollini, Don
4:29 PM
Dinoflagellates-two flagella
Blake, that's pretty vague, but in general, lots of what we are studying are definitions. So, yes.
4:30 PM
Which bacteria use a special structure to infect animal cells?
4:30 PM
Excuse me, I meant which protist?
4:31 PM
Jewell, Madison
4:31 PM
apicomplexans?
Johnson, Thomas
4:31 PM
apicomplexans
Cipollini, Don
4:31 PM
Madison-yes
Johnson, Thomas
4:31 PM
like plasmodium in malaria for example
Poole, Andrea
4:31 PM
Is the special structure the F pilus or is that something else?
Cipollini, Don
4:32 PM
Plasmodium is an example
Andrea-no. But, what is the pilus that requires the F factor for producrion?
4:33 PM
Roose, Lauren
4:33 PM
the sex pilus required the f factor
Ezenagu, Oluebube
4:33 PM
F pilus is for conjugation in bacteria
Cipollini, Don
4:33 PM
yes
What is transferred during conjugation?
4:34 PM
Ezenagu, Oluebube
4:34 PM
plastids
- Massie, Amber joined the Main Room. ( 7:35 PM ) -
Cipollini, Don
4:35 PM
plasmids
plastids are organelles in plant cells
4:35 PM
Where did the originate from?
4:35 PM
Yancey, Allison
4:35 PM
In the book it said that gram negative bacteria is more toxic but is it harder to kill gram positive bacteria or gram negative bacteria?
Roose, Lauren
4:35 PM
It is harder to kill gram positive because of the thick peptidoglycan layer
Stahl, Wyatt
4:35 PM
endosymbiosis
Ezenagu, Oluebube
4:36 PM
yes plasmids, not plastid sorry
Cipollini, Don
4:36 PM
Yes, the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria can lead to toxin production when it is attacked by immune cells. Gram positive can be harder to kill because of the cell wall structure.
Wyatt-yes
4:36 PM
Are flagella in sperm cells of a fern a derived or ancestral trait?
4:37 PM
Adkins, Blake
4:37 PM
ancestral?
Fox, Cameron
4:38 PM
derived?
Johnson, Thomas
4:38 PM
What exactly is lignin?
Cipollini, Don
4:38 PM
ancestral-why?
Stahl, Wyatt
4:38 PM
are they derived because they do not require their sperm to swim for reproduction?
Cipollini, Don
4:38 PM
Thomas-it is a compound present in cel walls that toughens them
Ezenagu, Oluebube
4:39 PM
So for apicomplexans, the specialized structure that allows them to penetrate host is just a complex of organelles right? or is the structure made of something else?
Fox, Cameron
4:39 PM
ancestrial because this means they are traits pasted down from there ancesters.
Cipollini, Don
4:39 PM
Cameron-yes
- Yi, Xixi left the Main Room. ( 7:40 PM ) -
Jewell, Madison
4:39 PM
not all seedless vascular plants have flagella but all nonvascular seedless plants do?
Fox, Cameron
4:40 PM
where as derived traits are ones through evolution and not something pasted down.
Cipollini, Don
4:40 PM
Oluebube-yes is is a complex of organelles that would do things like excrete proteins to aid in penetrating a host cell.
Kessler, Karleigh
4:40 PM
Are there only 5 derived traits?
- Massie, Amber left the Main Room. ( 7:41 PM ) -
Cipollini, Don
4:40 PM
Madison-all seedless vascular plants would have flageela (their sperm still swim). Remeber even some ancient gymnosperms have swimming sperm.
- Kash, Gary left the Main Room. ( 7:42 PM ) -
Cipollini, Don
4:41 PM
5 main ones that we discussed

Would seed be one?
Cipollini, Don
4:44 PM
no, that came much later.
Roose, Lauren
4:44 PM
roots?
Stahl, Wyatt
4:44 PM
the development of xylem and phloem
Johnson, Thomas
4:45 PM
gametes that could be disperesed by wind and not solely by water?
Cipollini, Don
4:45 PM
those things all helped, but they show up a little later
Poole, Andrea
4:45 PM
Would they have to adapt to absorb things like CO2 from the atmosphere or is that similar to what it would be underwater?
Cipollini, Don
4:45 PM
Andrea,
Kessler, Karleigh
4:45 PM
the ability to reproduce without aquatic environments for the sperm to swim, thus the heterospory adaption
Ezenagu, Oluebube
4:45 PM
Embryo that is nutured by mother plant
Cipollini, Don
4:46 PM
Andrea, good one. That would require adaptations to take in carbon dioxide from the air instead of simply absorbing it through the epidermis underwater.
Karleigh and Oluebibe, yes and yes
4:46 PM
what are archaea?
4:46 PM
Adkins, Blake
4:47 PM
like example of archaea? extremophiles, halophiles ect
Brooks, Michael
4:47 PM
Extremophiles and methanogens
Shadmanov, Aziz
4:48 PM
Archaea are a type of bacteria that can survive in harsh conditions
Cipollini, Don
4:48 PM
yes, but what makes them different from bacteria?
Poole, Andrea
4:48 PM
They only have polysaccaride membranes
- Yi, Xixi joined the Main Room. ( 7:49 PM ) -
Brooks, Michael
4:48 PM
they don't have peptidoglycan
Jewell, Madison
4:48 PM
lack peptidoglycan in their cell membrane
Roose, Lauren
4:48 PM
They have polysaccharides and proteins but lack peptidogylcan
Cipollini, Don
4:48 PM
yes
Adkins, Blake
4:48 PM
they lack peptidoglycon
- Stevens, Cole joined the Main Room. ( 7:50 PM ) -
Cipollini, Don
4:49 PM
Bacteria reproduce qucikly and don;t live long, usually. What is a strture that allows some bacteria to survive for a very long time?
Roose, Lauren
4:50 PM
endospores
Brooks, Michael
4:50 PM
endospores
Cipollini, Don
4:50 PM
yes
Adkins, Blake
4:50 PM
will this chat be visible after its over?
Cipollini, Don
4:51 PM
I am going to try to save it.
Fox, Cameron
4:51 PM
endospores helps allow survival in the harsh extremem envirnments such as exptreme heat and in water.

What is one way that you can tell that Gingko is ancient in terms of other gymnosperms?
Roose, Lauren
4:52 PM
In exotoxins, how does the prokaryote secrete the toxin? I know endotoxins are secreted after death but I don't understand exotoxins.
Poole, Andrea
4:52 PM
When do plants switch from archegonia to sporangia?
Kessler, Karleigh
4:53 PM
for the ginko is it that they still have flagellated sperm?
Adkins, Blake
4:53 PM
perfect. thank you. also for anyone that is intrested in studying together. I will be in the libary (level 2) tomorrow before the exam studying starting at 10am. Ill be the one with the white dog :)
Cipollini, Don
4:53 PM
Karleigh-yes
Fox, Cameron
4:54 PM
I will try and see about joining you at the library. I have class in the morning from 9:05 to 10:00 but Ill see about hitting the library for reviewing.
Cipollini, Don
4:54 PM
Lauren, exotoxins are secreted through a protein based secretory system that transports them across the wall.. Remember that such an apparatus was also the evolutionary origin of flagella.

Anther?
Fox, Cameron
5:02 PM
To be more spesific, when we talked of the differnt trees of the Division Coniferophtya, do we need to make sure to remember the traits disscused in class about the different trees? or just know what group they belong to? Similarly to the the other groups of plants and trees we talked about.
Cipollini, Don
5:02 PM
Andrea, yes in general, but they are in different supergroups for a reason. What are the main differences beyween those supergroups?
Cameron. If you mean the specific species I referred to, they were there to illustrate the diversity and importance of the groups.
5:03 PM
and to share the main features
5:03 PM
Poole, Andrea
5:03 PM
Is the difference the SAR has two flagellum?
Ezenagu, Oluebube
5:04 PM
That would the difference between Stramenophile and Archeaplastids supergroup right?
Poole, Andrea
5:04 PM
Then the archeaplastids have none?
Ezenagu, Oluebube
5:04 PM
Just trying to make sure i understood the question
Stevens, Cole
5:05 PM
In the lectures, there were some specific species examples of bacteria given with their relevance. Ex: in the bacteria + archea powerpoint, for alpha-epsilon proteobacteria there were specific species given for each subgroup. Generally speaking, will we be expected to remember the specific exmples used in the lectures, or are they just inserted as an example species?
Cipollini, Don
5:06 PM
yes, the two divergent flagella in stramenopiles is one difference. Red and green algae would not have those.
