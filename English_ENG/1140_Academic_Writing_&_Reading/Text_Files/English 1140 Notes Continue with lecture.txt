	Evaluate non academic resources

	- academic  supports are claims with academic information

	Non academic sources are for recent events that have just happened. 
	- This includes when trying to discern public opinion or opinion of a group
	- This can also be used for writing about unsusual or obscure topics that cant be found with scholarly search


	But this ha a draw back on grade. The writing will be poorly qualified. 

	Source:
	Valid: Is this related to my purpose(Will it move yourself forward or add to your paper to your point you are getting across)? 
		Is it relevent? 


	Reliable: Check the author, when it is published? Can you ge the full text access? Also check the level of discourse
		If academic sorce


	Bias: What is the stance? What is the perspective the author is coming from? Whois the publisher? 






	For non academic paper

	Valitity: Does the source say something that actually contributes to your paper?


	Reliability: Does the article have an author listed? What are the credentials of the author? 
			What is the date the article is posted? Also look at the level of discourse? 
			There could be hyperlinks where the author got there information from
			 or phrases the find original articles to get more informaton


	Bias: look for counterarguments, check the authors bio for group memberships, who is the website host that hosts the article? 
		How prominent are the adds on the pages? More adds means not good for in depth reading.
