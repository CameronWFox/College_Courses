1140 English Class Notes Continue with Summery

(These notes may be tricky to fully understand but I do my best)

Third Person

- academic writing uses third person and does 
  not like first person and second person writing

- It is good to focus on the text itself and 
  forget about using first person

- you can state the claim and the show why it is true 
  then let the reader choose for themselves what they 
  think instead of being hesitent with first person


Present Tense

- Reflect on what is going on now

- Stating what is happening right now


Assertive Verbs

- Verbs that state an action being taken

- These are not verbs that give a vaigue 
  discription of what is happening


- A thesaurus is good for finding synonyms for given words
  but not all are interchangeable

- but use it to find words you know  that just slip your mind


- All three of these topics are about how you word what you say. 

- What tense or how you word a verb or how you write your paper.

- Are you in forst person and seeing it there or 
  third person looking on from the outside


In Order To Write Well

- Credibility
	- write well people will take you more seriously

	- Flawed writing will make it harder and they will 
	  take you less seriously

- Accessibility
	- People will be able to understand you when you write well

	- If you write with errors, people will 
	  have a hard time to look past that

- Engagement
	- People will take pleasure in what you wrote

	- If your writting is difficult, people will 
	  be more likely to stop and but your writing down

- Connections are All There

	- Good ideas that can connect from point A to point B to point C

	- Its good to think in your own way but you need to write so you 
	  can point the writer in the write direction

	- If you dont connect your points so the reader can follow along
	  it will make it harder for the reader to follow along and understand
	  what he or she is reading and what it means.

Transitions Part 1

- ways of combining things together, comparing, contrasting
  comparing, or show cause and effect.
